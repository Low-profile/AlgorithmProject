Ideas:

1. Change the language model of the document model, change the bag-of-words model to n-gram.

Similiar to:
https://github.com/ars-ashuha/bigram-anchor-words

2.Run the algorithm in other domain, such as apply topic model in image analysis.

3.Change the farthest anchor-word finding algorithm, by using some heuristic method.
